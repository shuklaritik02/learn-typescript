// goal -> understand when to let TypeScript infer types
// ts -> js very well
// when ts will writes the types / u r going to write

let count = 0; //ts sees number
const site = "acedevhub"; // ts sees the exact literal "acedevhub"
const scors = [10, 20, 30];

//over annonation isnt bad -> just noisy

export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(5, 2));

//you should also annotate when the type is not obvious

let maybe: string | number;
maybe = Math.random() > 0.5 ? "test" : 10;
